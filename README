Module::Install::GetProgramLocations

A Module::Install extension that allows the user to interactively specify
the location of programs needed by the module to be installed. The specified
program will be converted to a full path and validated. If version information
is supplied, the version number of the program will also be checked.


NEW IN THIS VERSION

Version 0.3001: Mon Jun 6 2005
- Fixed a bug in program type reporting


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

To use this module, you will need to install:

- File::Spec
- Cwd
- Sort::Versions
- Module::Install

You should be prompted to install these modules automatically when you run
"perl Makefile.PL".


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You can install this package into a non-default location by appending one of
the following to the "perl Makefile.PL" command:

- "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom location),
- "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl directories)
- "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl directories).

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use ext::Module::Install;
  ...
  %info = ...;
  Get_Program_Locations(\%info);


INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email the results to the address
below, or submit a bug report on the project website as described in the
section REPORTING BUGS below.

For other bugs, see the section REPORTING BUGS below.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc Module::Install::GetProgramLocations". After installation on
Unix systems, you can also do "man Module::Install::GetProgramLocations".
