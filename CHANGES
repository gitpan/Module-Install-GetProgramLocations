Version 0.2000:
- Fixed version numbers, which were incompatible with some modules. (Thanks to
  Tassilo von Parseval <tassilo.von.parseval@rwth-aachen.de> for the bug
  report)
- Program locations are taken from %Config if they exist
- Added some new version functions (GNU make and g++)
- Improved dialogs so that they show which version(s) of the program that
  we're looking for.
- Added a feature to force the use of an invalid program, if the user
  specifies it twice in a row. This will prevent infinite loops in automated
  testing. (Thanks to Barbie <barbie@missbarbell.co.uk> for bug report)

Version 0.10.2:
- Fixed a bug where the default program would not be tried if the value from
  %Config failed.
- Fixed a bug in the documentation about including the module, and fixed the
  Get_...Version functions so that they will be automatically and implicitly
  invoked by Module::Install

- Fixed auto-import of dependencies for this extension

Version 0.10.0: Wed Sep 15 2004
